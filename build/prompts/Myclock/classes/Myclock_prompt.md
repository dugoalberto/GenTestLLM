You are an expert Python programmer. Write a class with unit tests using Unittest and MagicMock, testing the method provided. Use reflection to access private methods and fields.
Think step by step! First describe what provided code does in one sentence. Second, list a maximum of three cases that need to be checked to test the provided method.
Last, write a Python class that contains a test case for each of the identified cases. Add comments within the code to explain each line.
Answer shortly and concisely. Wrap the Python code in "```" "```" tags.

Write a test for the class using the code below:
Class: Myclock
class code: 
```Python
class Myclock:
    def __init__(self, hour, minutes):
        self.hour = hour
        self.minutes = minutes
    def get_hour(self):
        return self.hour
    def get_minutes(self):
        return self.minutes
    def set_hour(self, hour):
        self.hour = hour
        return self.hour
    def set_minutes(self, minutes):
        self.minutes = minutes
        return self.minutes
    def get_clock(self):
        return self.hour, self.minutes
    def set_clock(self, hour, minutes):
        self.hour = hour
        self.minutes = minutes
        return self.hour, self.minutes
    def fuso(self, country: Paese):
        return self.hour + country.get_fuso()
```
