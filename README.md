## Generating test with LLM
That's a script in which use you can use a pool of different LLMs, the base idea came from Meta's paper [https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09171](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09171)
This is a reformulation in python for python code of florianmende repository [florianmende/thesis-llm-test-generation](https://github.com/florianmende/thesis-llm-test-generation)
